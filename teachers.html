                <h2>Freshman Direct Admission to Informatics (INFO)</h2>
                <p>Informatics is a capacity constrained major and we want to offer students interested in the field the
                    opportunity to be part of the Information School community from their first day as a Husky. Direct
                    Admission gives high school students with a strong interest in studying Informatics the chance to
                    apply to the iSchool while filling out their UW application. By simply selecting “Informatics” as
                    a first-choice major on the general UW application, students will automatically be considered
                    for Direct Admission.</p>

                        target="_blank">Freshman Direct Admit Resource Site</a>
                </p>
                <p>Through the iTech Inclusion Symposium we want to introduce students to INFO and also create a
                    space where your students can envision themselves in the tech world. We believe by bringing your
                    students to this event they will be able to get a better idea of the impactful and innovative
                    projects and lessons that INFO students partipate in, and as a result be able to have an easier
                    decision on whether they would like to pursue Freshman Direct Admission. The sooner they are able to
                    make this decision, the sooner we are able to connect them with the best resources to make them
                    strong college applicants.

                <h2>Photos of Students Disclosure</h2>
                <p>If minors are participating in an event on the UW campus, we are allowed to take pictures. However,
                    we
                    respect that not everyone wants their picture taken or that you may not want your students' photos
                    to be used for promotional purposes. When checking-in we will offer colored sticker dots, that if a
                    student places on their nametag, means we will not use their picture in any manner.
